Hey! I'm currently working on my Master's Thesis about Phishing Countermeasures in the field of Cybersecurity at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) in Brazil. At the same time, I am finishing a BSc. in Computer Science at the University of São Paulo (USP).

Of all the projects I have ever done, the ones that I enjoy the most are related to Computer Security. Besides that, I also have done projects related to Website Development, Computer Graphics, Operating Systems, Physics Simulation, and Systems Programming.

## Short Biography

During my third year of high school, I was invited by MIT Brazil to participate in a project called MURSS to develop a PID algorithm for a simple robot powered by an Arduino chip in a custom track. The whole schedule took two weeks and made me choose a major in Computer Science instead of Computer Engineering.

As soon as I got into college I received an internship proposition to develop from scratch all the web interfaces, including a client dashboard/onboard for a recently founded fintech called S3Bank.

Even though I liked it, I became more interested in Cybersecurity and started studying/solving some challenges. That was the moment that I became aware of the "Computer Systems Security" class from Arizona State Universty, hosted by professor [Yan Shoshitaishvili](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ff1RkwcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the [pwn.college](pwn.college) infrastructure and ended up solving more than 360 hard binary exploitation challenges, worth it of receiving a Yellow Belt award in the platform. 

Following that, I got in touch with professor [Lourenço Pereira](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=paVNXpIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from Aeronautics Institute of Technology to start Undergraduate Research about Malware prevention on Windows Systems, which turned out to be published at SBSeg 2023.

After getting in contact with professor Yan, regarding a research collaboration, I started my Master's at the same time that I finish the last two years of my graduation, which is quite unconventional and only allowed at the Aeronautics Institute of Technology.

Right now, I'm working with a Microsoft Security Engineer toward a phishing prevention system as well as collaborating in a phishing research with PhD Students from the SEFCOM laboratory at Arizona State University.
